TASK 02: GIT BRANCHING - SOLUTION
==================================

ALL GIT COMMANDS USED:
----------------------
STEPS: 

1. git checkout -b feature/add-scripts
   - Creates a new branch called 'feature/add-scripts' and switches to it

2. [Modified package.json to add scripts section]

3. git add package.json
   - Stages the modified package.json file

4. git commit -m "Add npm scripts to package.json"
   - Commits the changes on the feature branch

5. git checkout main
   - Switches back to the main branch

6. cat package.json
   - Verifies that main branch still has the old version (no scripts)

7. git checkout -b feature/add-dependencies
   - Creates another new branch from main and switches to it

8. git branch -a
   - Lists all branches in the repository

9. git checkout main
   - Switches back to main branch for merging

10. git merge feature/add-scripts
    - Merges the feature/add-scripts branch into main

11. git branch -d feature/add-scripts
    - Deletes the merged feature branch

12. git branch -a
    - Lists all remaining branches

13. git log --graph --oneline --all
    - Shows commit history with graph visualization


OUTPUT OF git branch -a AT DIFFERENT STAGES:
--------------------------------------------

Stage 1 - After creating both feature branches:
  feature/add-dependencies
  feature/add-scripts
  main

Stage 2 - After merging and deleting feature/add-scripts:
  feature/add-dependencies
* main


OUTPUT OF git log --graph --oneline:
-------------------------------------
* 3bcbde6 Add npm scripts to package.json
* b3ed1f2 Add README and package.json
* e6ea051 Add .gitignore file


KEY OBSERVATIONS:
-----------------

1. Branch Creation: git checkout -b creates and switches to a new branch in one command

2. Branch Isolation: Changes on feature/add-scripts were not visible on main until merged

3. Fast-Forward Merge: The merge was a fast-forward (no merge commit needed) because 
   main had no new commits since the branch was created

4. Branch Cleanup: After merging, the feature branch was safely deleted with -d flag

5. Multiple Branches: feature/add-dependencies remains unmerged and still exists
