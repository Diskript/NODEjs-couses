16. git log --oneline --graph
    - Views commit history with graph visualization


CONFLICT MARKERS CONTENT:
--------------------------

<<<<<<< HEAD
# My Awesome Project v1
=======
# My Super Project v2
>>>>>>> feature/update-readme-v2


HOW THE CONFLICT WAS RESOLVED:
-------------------------------

The conflict occurred because both branches modified the same line (the title) in README.md.

Resolution Strategy:
- Combined both titles creatively into: "My Awesome Super Project v1 & v2"
- This preserves the intent of both changes
- Removed all conflict markers (<<<<<<, =======, >>>>>>>)
- Kept the rest of the file unchanged


FINAL COMMIT MESSAGE:
---------------------

"Merge feature/update-readme-v2: Resolve conflict by combining both titles"


GIT LOG OUTPUT (with graph):
-----------------------------

*   4d3c1e0 Merge feature/update-readme-v2: Resolve conflict by combining both titles

* e6ea051 Add .gitignore file


KEY LEARNINGS:
--------------

1. Merge Conflicts: Occur when the same lines are modified in different branches

2. Conflict Markers:
   - <<<<<<< HEAD: Shows current branch content
   - =======: Separates the two versions
   - >>>>>>> branch-name: Shows incoming branch content

3. Resolution Process:
   - Identify conflicting sections
   - Decide how to combine or choose changes
   - Remove all conflict markers
   - Stage and commit the resolved file

4. Fast-Forward vs 3-Way Merge:
   - First merge was fast-forward (no divergent history)
   - Second merge required 3-way merge (divergent branches)

5. Good Commit Messages: Describe what was merged and how conflicts were resolved
